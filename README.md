# FocusME
A single button addon for warriors that will use all tools in your toolkit to make the mob focus you.<br/>
  It will attempt to cast Taunt>Mocking Blow>Challenging Shout if former is on cooldown.<br/>
  If target is not in range, addon will attempt to shorten the distance with Charge or Intervene.<br/>
  Addon is spammable, meaning if you are expecting someone to pull aggro, you can keep pressing the button and addon will taunt as soon as you lose threat.

# VERY IMPORTANT
## For this addon to work you need to place your Taunt spell in slot number 25!

# Addon has 3 commands:<br/>
<br/>
/focusme - it will end rotation in stance that you are currently in after forcing mob to attack you.<br/>
/focusmeberserk - it will end rotation in Berserker Stance.<br/>
/focusmedefensive - it will end rotation in Defensive Stance.<br/>

<br/>It is advised that you create macros with /startattack, for that you will need [Roid-Macros addon](https://github.com/DennisWG/Roid-Macros).
Macros should look like this:
```
/startattack
/focusme
```
```
/startattack
/focusmeberserk
```
```
/startattack
/focusmedefensive
```
